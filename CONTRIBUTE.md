# Contribute!

### ***Accepting November & December Submissions***
***


Thanks so much for wanting to contribute. We welcome content ideas that you think the Go Pulse Newsletter should include. This newsletter will be constantly evolving and growing, so please do make suggestions! 

The *types of content section* detailed below is merely meant to serve as a guideline and source of inspiration rather than a hard restriction on what we accept. 

## Types of Content

***> Gopher Recognition:***
Is there someone from the Golang community that you think deserves recognition? We'd love to hear about their contributions and why you appreciate them.

***> Events:***
Send us links to interesting Go events / meetups / conferences!

***> Technical News:***
This section should be pretty self-explanatory. Send us cool technical blog posts or feature / product releases the Go community should know about! 

***> Community Direction:***
We believe that Go is much more than just a language, and that the community is a very integral aspect of being a Gopher. We would love content regarding the people aspect of the Golang community.

***> Gopher Column:***
We would love to have YOU write about specific topics you're interested in directly in our newsletter. Maybe you have bite-sized tidbits to share about performance, testing, scalability, or go routines! Tell us about it.

***> Job Opportunity:***
Are you trying to fill a position? We'd love to help you out. Give us more details on the role, level of hire your looking for, and location / whether you accept remote candidates. 

***> Guest Editor:***
We want this Go Pulse to distinctly have a voice behind each newsletter. When we have guest editors, the top of the newsletter will be an introduction of the editor as well as a paragraph of their thoughts of their choosing.
