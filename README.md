# Go Pulse Newsletter

***What is it?*** 

Go Pulse Newsletter is a monthly newsletter curated with love by the [GoBridge org](https://golangbridge.org/) and released at the top of each month. 

***Another newsletter? Why should I read this?***

Good question! We wanted a newsletter with a bit of heart, curated and written by gophers for gophers. We also wanted to be able to use our platform to bring attention to things that deserve some attention.
