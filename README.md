# Go Pulse
What is it? 
Go Pulse is a monthly newsletter curated with love by the GoBridge org and released at the top of each month.

Why is it named Go Pulse? 
Good question. We want a newsletter with a bit of heart, written by gophers for gophers, that shares things that either deserve attention or things that people already care about.
